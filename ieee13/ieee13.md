This circuit model is very small and used to test common features of distribution analysis software, 
operating at 4.16 kV. It is characterized by being short, relatively highly loaded, a single voltage regulator at the substation, 
overhead and underground lines, shunt capacitors, an in-line transformer, and unbalanced loading.
